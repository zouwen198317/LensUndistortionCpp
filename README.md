For Windows, CMake variables are supposed to be set as:
- OpenCV_DIR: OpenCV_BUILD_DIR
- Qt5Core_DIR: QT5_CMAKE_DIR/Qt5Core
- Qt5Gui_DIR: QT5_CMAKE_DIR/Qt5Gui
- Qt5PrintSupport_DIR: QT5_CMAKE_DIR/Qt5PrintSupport
- Qt5Widget_DIR: QT5_CMAKE_DIR/Qt5Widget

where OpenCV_BUILD_DIR is the directory where OpenCVConfig.cmake is stored and QT5_CMAKE_DIR is set as C:/Qt/5.5/msvc2013/lib/cmake
